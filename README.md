Building a Scalable Data Platform for Q Company: Enhancing Retail Insights with Spark and Hive 
Welcome to our documentation on developing a robust data platform for Q Company, a leading retailer operating through both physical branches and an E-commerce platform. In this project, we designed and implemented a scalable solution to manage and process data efficiently, leveraging the power of Apache Spark and Apache Hive. 
Our data platform handles both batch and streaming data, ensuring timely and accurate insights for various business needs. Every hour, new files are ingested into our data lake, processed, and stored in a Hive-based data warehouse. This allows for seamless tracking of transactions, sales performance, and customer behavior. 
Additionally, our platform processes real-time logs from the company app using Kafka and Spark Streaming, providing actionable insights from dynamic data. This presentation will walk you through the technical implementation and business insights derived from our data platform, demonstrating its impact on Q Company's operations and decision-making processes.
